       <p>Christine has been passionate about music and performing for as long as she can remember. She began dance lessons at the age of five and, by seven, was touring with a children’s performing group, bringing joy to audiences at schools, businesses, and community events. At nine, she discovered her love for theatre through her first community production, and from that moment on, the stage became her second home.
           <br>
           <br>
Her love for the performing arts led her across the world after high school, where she implemented a theatre program at Shandong Teacher’s University in China, using theatre as a dynamic tool to teach English. She later had the incredible opportunity to direct university productions nationwide, collaborating with college students to bring their stories to life on stage. In addition to directing, Christine spent years managing a theatre, gaining invaluable experience in production planning, operations, and creating a welcoming space for performers and audiences alike.
           <br>
           <br>
Christine’s expertise extends beyond directing—she has also worked as a vocal instructor, choreographer, and dance instructor, helping students develop their skills and confidence in singing, movement, and stage presence. Her well-rounded background in all aspects of performance allows her to guide young performers in discovering their full artistic potential.
           <br>
           <br>
Over the years, Christine has directed over 100 productions, ranging from beloved classics like Annie, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King to contemporary favorites like Moana Jr., Frozen Jr., and Shrek the Musical. In addition to full-scale productions, she has directed countless one-act plays, musical revues, and even written and produced original works.
           <br>
           <br>
Above all, Christine is a firm believer in the transformative power of the performing arts, especially for young people. Theatre builds confidence, fosters friendships, and provides a space for self-expression unlike any other. She is beyond grateful for the opportunity to bring the magic of theatre to families in her community—whether on stage, behind the scenes, or in the audience.
When she’s not in the theatre, Christine loves traveling, reading, and enjoying long drives with a great podcast and a Diet Coke in hand. She is also a proud wife and mother of six, cherishing every moment with her beautiful family.

        <img src="../Images/Copy%20of%20Danni%20Walch.jpg" alt="Danny Walch" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" style="max-width: 200px;">
       <p>Danni Walch Began her 49-year theatrical career with her stage debut at age four. She received early song and dance training through The Sundance Kids in Southern Utah and performed all over the state. Growing up in Cedar City Utah, Home of the Utah Shakespeare Festival, and born to a theatre-loving family, Danni was surrounded by the arts and blessed with many wonderful influences, shows, parades, and places to perform.
           <br>
           <br>
She pursued further training at Southern Utah University through a theatre scholarship, and was afforded invaluable experiences on stage, and off. As a dance minor, she studied ballet, modern and ragtime tap from the instructors at the American Folk Ballet, then continued her study of ragtime tap at Steps on Broadway in New York City. Danni had unique opportunities to perform at Disneyland, Opryland U.S.A, and
the United States Capital Building in Washington D.C. 
           <br>
           <br>
After re-locating to Los Angeles, Danni began 25 years at Glendale Centre Theatre where she starred in countless productions and where she always had a day-job, honing skills in many aspects of running a theatre. Danni worked as an usher, property mistress, box office manager, assistant director, and director- and never had to wait tables. A few of Danni’s shows at GCT include, The Happiest Millionaire, Life with Father, Annie, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and A Christmas Carol. 
           <br>
           <br>
Danni continued to train as an actress with Lieux Dressler and Gregory Franklin as a member of the Professional Actors Gym for 14 years. She became a coach at PAG NYC in 2002 and for several years more at PAG Los Angeles. She is a member of SAG-AFTRA and her guest/co-starring television credits include Diagnosis Murder, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Sisters, and the daytime drama Another World. Danni also played Cecily in The Importance of Being Earnest at the Fremont Centre in South Pasadena, and Juliet, Titania, and a Witch in Shakespearience at the historic Alex Theatre. 
           <br>
           <br>
Her favorite roles at other theatres are Vicki in Noises Off, Wendy in Peter Pan, and Corliss in Kiss and Tell. Shortly after moving to the Las Vegas area, Ms. Walch directed A Midsummer Night’s Dream for the Light of Liberty Commonwealth, which brought her to Seedling Theatre. She has loved teaching acting and musical theatre classes at Seedling since 2021 and she was honoured to play Mrs. Bennett in Seedling Theatre’s Pride and Prejudice in 2024. 
Danni’s most cherished role is being a mom to her four children.

       <p>Britni is married to her high school sweetheart and is the proud mom of three beautiful boys. Her soul's greatest joy and passion is her family - and when she isn’t homeschooling or chasing her rambunctious boys around, she can be found doing her next greatest passion: Teaching. 
           <br>
           <br>
Britni Favero has been teaching voice for over 14 years and is passionate about helping singers of all ages discover their unique voice and build confidence in their talents. As a certified vocal instructor with the Institute for Vocal Advancement (IVA), and previously certified with Speech Level Singing (SLS) under Maestro Seth Riggs, Britni brings extensive training and ongoing education to her teaching. She works with students from 8 to 98… offering private voice lessons, as well as leading multiple group vocal classes at Seedling Theatre Company.
           <br>
           <br>
Britni’s students have achieved remarkable success, with dozens nominated for the prestigious Nevada High School Musical Awards, and a student earning a spot at the renowned Jimmy Awards in New York City. While Britni’s primary focus is on Musical Theatre, she also enjoys working with students in pop and other genres, always striving to help them strengthen their skills and reach their goals. 
           <br>
           <br>
Her own journey into teaching is rooted in a deep love for singing, even when opportunities for formal training were limited during her youth. After high school, Britni sought out top-notch vocal instruction with Jeffrey Skouson, who encouraged her to pursue teaching. Today, she continues to grow as an educator through regular training with master teachers from around the world.
Britni has performed in various settings, including student showcases, weddings, and fundraisers, and cherishes her time on stage as beloved Marmee from the musical “Little Women”. She is dedicated to helping her students shine on stage, sharing the joy of singing one student at a time.  
           <br>
